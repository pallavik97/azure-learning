# Deploying an AKS cluster using Terraform involves several steps
 ### Step 1: Install Terraform
 Ensure you have Terraform installed on your local machine. You can download it from the official website: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install
### Step 2: Configure Azure Credentials
#### Make sure you have your Azure credentials available. You can set them using the Azure CLI:
> az login
### Step 3: Create a Terraform Configuration File
#### Create a new file, for example, main.tf, to define your Terraform configuration. Add the main.tf content:

### Step 4: Customize Terraform Configuration
#### Replace the placeholder values such as YourResourceGroupName, YourAKSClusterName, YourDNSPrefix, YourServicePrincipalClientId, and YourServicePrincipalClientSecret with your own values.
### Step 5: Initialize and Apply Terraform Configuration
#### In the same directory as your Terraform configuration file, run the following commands:
> terraform init
#### Apply the changes
> terraform apply
#### Terraform will prompt you to confirm the actions it will take. Type yes to proceed.
### Step 6: Access AKS Cluster
#### After the deployment is complete, update your kubectl configuration to use the new AKS cluster:
> az aks get-credentials --resource-group YourResourceGroupName --name YourAKSClusterName
#### Now, you should be able to use kubectl to interact with your AKS cluster.
### Step 7: Clean Up (Optional)
#### If you want to delete the AKS cluster when you're done, run:
> terraform destroy
#### Terraform will prompt you to confirm the destruction of resources. Type yes to proceed.
